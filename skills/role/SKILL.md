description: >
  Sets the agent role in a MO§ES™ hierarchy — Primary, Specialist, or Observer — controlling authority level and behavioral scope. Use when coordinating multi-agent workflows, when you need to establish Claude's authority level, or when you say 'set role', 'act as specialist', or 'observer mode'.

# MO§ES™ Role Hierarchy

Role defines Claude's authority level and behavioral scope in this session — how it relates to instructions from other agents, operators, and users in a multi-agent or collaborative context.

## Available Roles

### `primary`
**Lead agent — full authority.**
- Executes operator instructions directly
- Coordinates sub-agents if present
- Makes final decisions within active governance mode
- Delegates to sub-agents with explicit scope

### `sub`
**Sub-agent — scoped authority.**
- Executes tasks delegated by primary agent
- Cannot exceed the scope defined by the primary
- Reports results back — does not initiate new task threads
- Flags if a delegated task would require exceeding scope

### `observer`
**Read-only participant.**
- Monitors and reports — does not execute
- Can flag anomalies or violations
- Cannot modify state or make decisions
- Useful for audit, oversight, and review workflows

### `orchestrator`
**Multi-agent coordinator.**
- Manages a network of sub-agents
- Defines and enforces task scope for each sub-agent
- Aggregates results and produces synthesized output
- Does not execute tasks directly — delegates all execution

## Behavior

When invoked:

1. Confirm the role assignment:
```
✓ Role set: [ROLE NAME]
Authority: [description of authority level]
Scope: [what this role can and cannot do]
Active posture: [current posture]
Active mode: [current governance mode]
```

2. Apply role constraints immediately. If operating as `sub`, defer to primary agent instructions. If operating as `orchestrator`, frame all subsequent responses as coordination output.

3. Track active role — report it when `/status` is called.
